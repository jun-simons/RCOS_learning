Potential links for search:
root = https://directory.rpi.edu/pplsearch
 - root directory for people search
 To search a first and last name, we would simply use:
    root + "first" + "last" 
 assuming first and last are strings containing the name data
 
 This implementation should allow for relatively simple scraping of data.
 
 To get professor data, we would take the most up to date data from the QUACS github,
 which is frequently updated.  This contains first and last name but NOT rcs id.
 We would then cross check through the people search feature to find information.
